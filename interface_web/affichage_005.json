                "abstract": "For decades, chemotherapy has been the mainstay of breast cancer treatment. Novel therapies are expanding the therapeutic options and altering the treatment algorithms to manage this disease. The use and approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a few areas of progress. These therapies initially gained attention in the metastatic setting but have subsequently found a role in early-stage breast cancer. Although human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is at the center of ADC development, other surface antigens with a differential expression between tumor and normal cells may be appropriate for ADC targeting. This has led to the discovery of new ADCs targeting other receptors, including TROP-2, HER-3, and LIV-1, to name a few. Similarly, the addition of pembrolizumab in treating early-stage triple-negative breast cancer has led to exploring other ICIs in this setting. However, it has also raised important scientific questions regarding optimal patient selection, biomarkers that predict the success of ICIs, ideal chemotherapy partners, and the financial implications of bringing newer therapies to the forefront. In this review, we discuss the evolving landscape of ICIs and ADCs in managing early-stage breast cancer and provide an overview of potential future advancement in the field.",

The increasingly nuanced molecular subtypes of breast cancer have enhanced the comprehension and precision treatment of this disease. The mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer have been central to scientific research, with investigations spanning various perspectives such as tumor stemness, intra-tumoral microbiota, and circadian rhythms. Technological advancements, particularly those integrated with artificial intelligence, have significantly improved the accuracy of breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The emergence of novel therapeutic concepts and drugs represents a paradigm shift towards personalized medicine. Evidence suggests that optimal diagnosis and treatment models tailored to individual patient risk and expected subtypes are crucial, supporting the era of precision oncology for breast cancer. Despite the rapid advancements in oncology and the increasing emphasis on the clinical precision treatment of breast cancer, a comprehensive update and summary of the panoramic knowledge related to this disease are needed. In this review, we provide a thorough overview of the global status of breast cancer, including its epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and molecular subtyping. Additionally, we elaborate on the latest research into mechanisms contributing to breast cancer progression, emerging treatment strategies, and long-term patient management. This review offers valuable insights into the latest advancements in Breast Cancer Research, thereby facilitating future progress in both basic research and clinical application.",

For selecting patients likely to respond to endocrine therapy, both oestrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) should be measured on all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. On the other hand, for selecting likely response to all forms of anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib or ado-trastuzumab emtansine), determination of HER2 expression or gene copy number is mandatory. Where feasible, measurement of ER, PR and HER2 should be performed on recurrent lesions and the primary invasive tumour. Although methodological problems exist in the determination of Ki67, because of its clearly established clinical value, wide availability and low costs relative to the available multianalyte signatures, Ki67 may be used for determining prognosis, especially if values are low or high. In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative patients, multianalyte tests such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-PAI-1, Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index (BCI) and Prosigna (PAM50) may be used to predict outcome and aid adjunct therapy decision-making. Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict and Prosigna may be similarly used in patients with 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes. All laboratories measuring biomarkers for patient management should use analytically and clinically validated assays, participate in external quality assurance programs, have established assay acceptance and rejection criteria, perform regular audits and be accredited by an appropriate organisation.",

Determining prognosis can best be addressed with a combination of traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors, biomarkers such as HER2/neu and specific multigene genes tests. Amongst the best validated prognostic multigene tests are uPA/PAI1, Oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Oncotype DX and MammaPrint, may be used for predicting outcome and aiding adjunct therapy decision making in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers that are either lymph node-negative or node positive (1-3 metastatic nodes), while uPA/PAI-1 may be similarly used in ER-positive, lymph node-negative patients. For selecting likely response to endocrine therapy, both estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) should be measured. On the other hand, for identifying likely response to anti-HER2 therapy, determination of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression is necessary. To identify new prognostic and predictive biomarkers for breast cancer, current research is focusing on tumor and circulating DNA (ctDNA) and RNA (e.g., micro RNAs) and circulating tumor cells. A promising ctDNA biomarker is the mutational status of ER (ESR1) for predicting the emergence of resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Challenges for future research include the identification of biomarkers for predicting response to radiotherapy and specific forms of chemotherapy.",

This single-arm, phase II trial (NCT04685070) assessed the feasibility of neoadjuvant Aumolertinib for unresectable stage III NSCLCm. Fifty-six patients were enrolled, with 51 participants receiving neoadjuvant Aumolertinib (110 mg/day, orally) and forming the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included major pathological response (MPR) rate, pathological complete response (pCR) rate, complete (R0) resection rate, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The ORR was 70.6% (95% confidence interval: 58%-84%), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. Additionally, twenty-three (45.1%) participants converted into resectable disease and underwent surgery. Among them, R0 resection, MPR and pCR rates were 100%, 21.7%, and 13.0%, respectively. The median EFS and OS were not reached. While, the 1- and 2-year EFS rates were 88.2% and 58.8%, respectively. Fatigue (49.0%), alanine aminotransferase concentration elevation (39.2%), and rash (35.3%) were the most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 5 patients (9.8%), and no grade 5 TRAE was recorded. RNA-sequencing based analysis revealed increased infiltration of CD8 + T-cells in post-treatment tumors compared to baseline, particularly in responsive and Ex19-Del mutation tumors. Collectively, neoadjuvant Aumolertinib showed promising efficacy and a surgical conversion rate with a tolerable safety profile for unresecable NSCLCm in stage III, potentially involved in the remodeling of tumor microenvironment.",

                "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a worldwide public health dilemma and is currently the most common tumour in the globe. Awareness of breast cancer, public attentiveness, and advancement in breast imaging has made a positive impact on recognition and screening of breast cancer. Breast cancer is life-threatening disease in females and the leading cause of mortality among women population. For the previous two decades, studies related to the breast cancer has guided to astonishing advancement in our understanding of the breast cancer, resulting in further proficient treatments. Amongst all the malignant diseases, breast cancer is considered as one of the leading cause of death in post menopausal women accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. It is a global issue now, but still it is diagnosed in their advanced stages due to the negligence of women regarding the self inspection and clinical examination of the breast. This review addresses anatomy of the breast, risk factors, epidemiology of breast cancer, pathogenesis of breast cancer, stages of breast cancer, diagnostic investigations and treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapies, hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy, complementary therapies, gene therapy and stem-cell therapy etc for breast cancer.",
